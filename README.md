MNIST classifier from scratch
* Model: CNN
* Accuracy: 97%

* Training Notebook: mnist_classifier.ipynb
  
* Cleaned Python Inference Version: mnist_classifier.py (This file is auto-generated from mnist_classifier.ipynb. Please do not edit it.)

* Model: classifier.pth

* Try Online: https://carlfeynman-mnist.hf.space/

* If you want to host this on Hugging Face as a space, please refer to [this documentation.](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-first-demo)

* To Run FastApi Server Locally: uvicorn server:app --reload
  
* Note: When you try it out on the website, accuracy may drop due to distribution changes from training data to canvas image input. It has not been adjusted or fine-tuned for this specific purpose; it's intended just to demonstrate the full flow.
